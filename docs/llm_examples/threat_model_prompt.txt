# Threat Model Prompt (Sanitized)

## Context
We're building an ACME Trustworthy Module Registry with the following architecture:
- API Gateway → Lambda (Upload/Search/Auth) → ECS Fargate Validator → S3 + DynamoDB
- JWT authentication, IAM roles, KMS encryption, CloudWatch monitoring

## Request
Help us identify STRIDE threats for this system, focusing on:
1. Spoofing: How could attackers impersonate users or services?
2. Tampering: What data could be modified in transit or at rest?
3. Repudiation: What actions need non-repudiation guarantees?
4. Information Disclosure: Where could sensitive data leak?
5. Denial of Service: What could cause service unavailability?
6. Elevation of Privilege: How could users gain unauthorized access?

Consider trust boundaries between:
- External clients → API Gateway
- API Gateway → Lambda/ECS
- Compute → AWS data stores (S3, DynamoDB)
- Compute → Security services (KMS, Secrets Manager)

## What We Used
Used this prompt to brainstorm initial threat list, then reviewed against:
- AWS security best practices
- Course lecture material on STRIDE methodology
- Our actual IAM policies and encryption settings

Final threats documented in `docs/security/stride-threat-model.md`.
