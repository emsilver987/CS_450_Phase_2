This is a simulated GPT-2 model weights file for testing purposes.
It contains dummy weight data that represents a 117M parameter GPT-2 model.
The actual content doesn't matter for testing the upload functionality,
but this simulates the structure of a real PyTorch model file.

File size: ~500MB (simulated)
Model type: GPT-2
Architecture: Transformer
Layers: 12
Hidden size: 768
Attention heads: 12
Vocabulary size: 50,257

This file would normally contain the actual model weights
in PyTorch's state_dict format, but for testing purposes,
we're using this placeholder content.
